All stall holders we interacted with were super friendly, warm and helpful. They all appeared happy to be interacting with customers and feeding the crowds. Each food store specialises in a different type of food. Everything we ate was delicious!

After watching the sunset it got dark really fast, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s when I realized I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get an Uber to come up. I panicked a bit because the only way down was by bus and I had no money on my T-money card. I managed to reload it at the 7-Eleven and just hopped on the first bus going down the mountain.

First of all, Klook will screw you over with the tickets as if it falls on the weekend, your pick up area will be closed and klook will make you run around with no reconciliation, really sad and the ticket counter wasnt helpful either, we have all the details but nope had to buy new tickets. Then the cable car itself, you want to enjoy the view, good luck. They will pile 30 of you in there squashed till you reach the top and then the same coming down.
